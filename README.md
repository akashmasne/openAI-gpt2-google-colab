This is a basic NLP based spam detector.
The NLP model is trained with classic spam/ham dataset provided by UCI. Message with words like free bonus,credit card, send sms winner,etc are detected as spam. 
Message length does matter too. Spam messages tend to be lengthier than hams most of the time.
